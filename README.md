# ANO: A Principled Approach to Robust Policy Optimization

Official implementation of **ANO (Anchored Neighborhood Optimization)**.
> **Code Release:** This repository contains the reference implementation used in our experiments.

## 🔥 What is ANO?

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is widely used but faces a fundamental dilemma:
- **Hard clipping** discards useful gradient information from outliers → hurts sample efficiency.
- **Removing clipping** can lead to unbounded gradients → instability and hyper-parameter sensitivity.

ANO resolves this via a Principled Design Space and a geometric shaping principle: **redescending influence** — suppress extreme outliers smoothly while keeping informative gradients in moderately-off-policy regions.  It is designed to be smooth, trust-region bounded, robust to outliers, and structurally parsimonious (requiring only one convexity change).

## 📦 Environment Setup

- Experimental coverage (as in paper): **LLM fine-tuning (RLHF)**.

**Tested with**
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- Python: 3.8+
- CUDA: optional (recommended for large-scale / LLM experiments)

### Clone & create Conda env

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd ANO/

conda env create -f ano_trl.yml
conda activate ano_trl
````

## 🧪 Reproducing Experiments

We provide **script entrypoints** for training and evaluation.

### Training

```bash
bash bash_ano.sh
```

### Evaluation

First, fill in the DeepSeek API key at line 437 of trl/experimental/judges/judges.py where it says ```api_key=""```. 

Then, in judge.sh, complete the paths to the locally fine-tuned models you saved: set ```ano="your_anon_checkpoint-step"``` and ```ppo="your_ppo_checkpoint-step"```.

Finally

```bash
bash judge.sh
```
