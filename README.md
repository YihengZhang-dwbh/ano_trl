# ANO: A Unified RL Framework for Robust Policy Optimization

Official implementation of **ANO (Anchored Neighborhood Optimization)**.
> **Code Release:** This repository contains the reference implementation used in our experiments.

## 🔥 What is ANO?

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is widely used but faces a fundamental dilemma:
- **Hard clipping** discards useful gradient information from outliers → hurts sample efficiency.
- **Removing clipping** can lead to unbounded gradients → instability and hyper-parameter sensitivity.

**ANO** resolves this via a **Unified Trust Region Framework** and a new shaping principle: **redescending influence** — suppress extreme outliers smoothly while keeping informative gradients in moderately-off-policy regions.  It is designed to be **smooth**, **trust-region bounded**, **robust to outliers**, and **structurally minimal** (one convexity change).
